# Python Super Auto Pets Analog

I started this project because I wanted to create a SAP analog that I could use to train bots that are able to roll the shit out of children who play this game.

## Unit Tests

`python -m unittest tests/{nameOfTestSet}.py`

All Tests
`python -m unittest discover -s ./tests -p '*_test.py'`
