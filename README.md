# Python Super Auto Pets Analog

I started this project because I wanted to create a SAP analog that I could use to train bots that are able to roll the shit out of children who play this game.

## Unit Tests

`python -m unittest tests/{nameOfTestSet}.py`

or set up in vscode

## Pdoc3

`python -m pdoc --html ./src --force`
